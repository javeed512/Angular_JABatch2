What is NgRx?
NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular.
 NgRx provides libraries for:

Managing global and local state.
Isolation of side effects to promote a cleaner component architecture.
Entity collection management.
Integration with the Angular Router.
Developer tooling that enhances developer experience when building many different types of applications.
Packages
NgRx packages are divided into a few main categories

States

Store - RxJS powered global state management for Angular apps, inspired by Redux.

Effects - Side effect model for @ngrx/store.
Router Store - Bindings to connect the Angular Router to @ngrx/store.
Entity - Entity State adapter for managing record collections.
ComponentStore - Standalone library for managing local/component state.
Signals - Reactive store and set of utilities for Angular Signals.
Operators - Shared RxJS operators for NgRx libraries.

Developer Tools
Store Devtools - Instrumentation for @ngrx/store that enables visual tracking of state and time-travel debugging.
